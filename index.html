            <p>1. Just because you're online doesn't mean you're a different person. Actions on the web have the same consequences as actions taken in real life, whether it's liking a post, or writing a scathing review. It's necessary to recognize that we are still ourselves even when we are online. Thinking you can get away with something is never a good reason to do it. It's importantant to always keep in mind the golden rule, to treat others the way you want to be treated.</p>
          </div>
            <p>2. It's important to be very careful and tread lightly on the internet and in the cyberworld. The bigger your footprint online, the more likely it is you could get tracked, scammed or hacked. There are people on the web who will try to use your existance to their gain, and people aren't always who they say they are, especially in such an environment. By being careful and cautious on the web, you protect yourself from potential encounters with these people

            <p>The artice "The Dark Side" of Quantam Computers, discusses the dangers that come with the future of computer innovation. Quantum computers are built to do certain tasks at a far quicker rate than normal computers with normal styles of transfering information. The danger exists in the security of the internet. If these quantam computers can operate so quickly they would allow people to access information that couldn't before be reached. People in future years where quantam computers are more accessable, could even find information from the modern day that is completely secure, and recover it. There are efforts being taken currently by cryptographers to create more intricate and elaborate codes capable of preventing these quantam computer hacks. Nevertheless, this is absolutely a danger. </p>
